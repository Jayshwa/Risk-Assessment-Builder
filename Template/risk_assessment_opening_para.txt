NAME OF ORGANISATION want to ensure everyone undertaking activities organised in the name of NAME OF ORGANISATION are kept safe. 

This form is to be used where there is likelihood of potential harm or for an irregular activity. 
For example, a group may carry out a walking activity.  Most risks associated with walking will have been previously covered but there may be new risks / or risks unique to this occurrence i.e. a new location for the activity which also need to be listed 
This form should be completed within good time of the intended activity.  As the potential for harm increases so the need for the form to be submitted earlier also increases.  However, it is preferable that for all activities the form is reviewed at least 72 hours before hand.  Once the planning team have reviewed the form any feedback or questions will be passed on as soon as possible.  In the absence of any further comments after submission activity leaders can assume their assessment is approved and the activity can continue. 
In the situation of an open event unaccompanied children must be signed in and recorded for future reference. 

The form needs to be kept for 7 years upon completion of the activity 
Please return to NAME OF ORGANISATION so that it can be circulated to the NAME OF ORGANISATION.
