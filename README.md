# Risk-Assessment-Builder

My first python project for practicing and applying techniques, and for understanding python GUI's

Simple risk assessment builder that uses user defined input to create re-usable modules for risk assessments.

Allows the creation of risk assessments that are stored locally in directories created by the program.
